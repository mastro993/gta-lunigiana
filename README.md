# Grand Theft Auto: Lunigiana

> [!WARNING]
> **Grand Theft Auto: Lunigiana is in early development.** Today you can play one valley, about 6% of the planned map.

![Title card](docs/screenshots/title.png)

Grand Theft Auto: Lunigiana is an open-world car-theft game in isometric pixel art, set in Lunigiana, the valley of the Magra between Tuscany and Liguria. You walk village streets, steal parked cars (the Carabinieri’s Alfa Romeo included, from right outside their station), carjack traffic and run people down, on a map built from survey data of the real places. As many people are out as live nearby, so the village centres are busy and the country roads empty: villagers of every age walk alone, in couples, with their kids or a dog, stop to chat, glare at a speeding car, jump out of its way and are shocked by a death, while cats and dogs roam the villages and cows and pigs the farms. The isometric camera turns a quarter at a time on foot, follows the car while you drive so the road ahead is always up the screen, and renders at low resolution for a pixel-art look. A game day lasts 24 minutes under the real sun and moon, and the weather follows Italy’s climate at the map’s latitude and height, drawn day by day from national statistics: rain wets the roads, snow whitens the mountains, and both cost grip.

The game will cover all of Lunigiana, from the beaches at the mouth of the Magra to the Apennine ridge. Today the playable map is one valley of it, the [Valle del Lucido](#the-playable-map-today-the-valle-del-lucido).

This is a fan project. It isn’t affiliated with or endorsed by Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive; “Grand Theft Auto” is their trademark.

## Where the game is set: Lunigiana

Lunigiana is the basin of the river Magra and its tributaries. For the game, it’s 21 comuni covering 1,102 km²:

- **Province of Massa-Carrara, Tuscany**: the 14 Lunigiana comuni, Aulla, Bagnone, Casola in Lunigiana, Comano, Filattiera, Fivizzano, Fosdinovo, Licciana Nardi, Mulazzo, Podenzana, Pontremoli, Tresana, Villafranca in Lunigiana and Zeri
- **Province of La Spezia, Liguria**: the 7 comuni of the lower Val di Magra, Sarzana, Santo Stefano di Magra, Vezzano Ligure, Arcola, Castelnuovo Magra, Luni and Ameglia

It runs from about 7 km of coast, between Punta Bianca and the Torrente Parmignola, up to the Apennine ridge between Monte Gottero and Monte Belfiore, which rises to 1,978 m on Monte Casarola. The Apuan Alps close it to the south-east.

### How the map grows, part by part

The map grows one part at a time, each built from the same survey sources as today’s valley. The parts come in this order, tracked in [#3](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/3):

1. [Fivizzano, Casola and the upper Aulella](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/17): the walled town of Fivizzano, the Verrucola fortress and the SS63 hairpins
2. [Fosdinovo, the Bardine valley and the Apuan foothills](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/18): the Castello Malaspina on its crag, olive terraces and Colli di Luni vines
3. [Aulla and the Magra–Aulella–Taverone confluence](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/19): the Fortezza della Brunella, the first motorway (the A15 della Cisa) and the first wide river
4. [Sarzana and the lower Val di Magra](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/20): the first Ligurian part, with the fortresses of Sarzana and the A12–A15 junction
5. [The coast: Bocca di Magra, Marinella, Luni and Montemarcello](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/21): the sea, sand beaches, the Magra mouth and ancient Luni
6. [Bagnone and its valley up to the Sillara–Matto–Marmagna ridge](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/22): an arcaded borgo, its castles and passes up to 1,794 m
7. [Comano, the Lagastrello and the Cerreto](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/23): the Apennine passes above Fivizzano, with the most reliable winter snow in Lunigiana
8. [The middle Magra: Villafranca, Filattiera, Mulazzo and Pontremoli](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/24): Pontremoli’s Castello del Piagnaro and the chestnut country
9. [The Cisa, Brattello and Cirone passes](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/25): the source of the Magra and the A15’s high viaducts and tunnels
10. [Zeri, the Gordana and Teglia valleys and the Passo dei Due Santi](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/26): the Rossano plateau, sheep pastures and the Zum Zeri ski area

Parts 4 and 5 may swap. Before part 1, the engine has to scale: a single map file would exhaust a browser tab’s memory at about 320 km², less than a third of Lunigiana. The map moves into 2 km tiles loaded on demand ([#5](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/5)). Issues [#4](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/4) to [#12](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/12) cover the rest of the groundwork: raw inputs out of git, motorways and other main roads, wide rivers and lakes, terrain where the LiDAR surveys stop, older building maps and the Ligurian sources.

### New landscapes

These landscapes come alongside the parts:

- **Sea, coast and beaches**: the sea at 0 m, sand and pebble beaches, piers and the mouth of the Magra ([#13](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/13))
- **Forest types**: chestnut and oak in the valleys, beech above about 1,000 m and pines on the coast ([#14](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/14))
- **Olive groves and vineyards**: on the hills, where they render as meadow today ([#15](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/15))
- **Snow**: an early-spring snow line on the high Apennines, over bare beech woods ([#16](https://github.com/mastro993/gta-lunigiana/issues/16))

## The playable map today: the Valle del Lucido

The Valle del Lucido is a side valley of the Aulella in eastern Lunigiana, almost entirely in the comune of Fivizzano (province of Massa-Carrara). It runs a little over 14 km, from the flat, farmed valley floor at Gragnola, where the Lucido flows into the Aulella, up to pastures above 1,000 m in the northern Apuan Alps, under Pizzo d’Uccello and Monte Sagro. Local tradition calls the torrent *Lucido*, “bright”, for its clear water.

The Lucido has two branches, the Lucido di Vinca and the Lucido d’Equi, which meet on the valley floor at Monzone, under the 18th-century humpback bridge of Santa Lucia. Monzone has two halves: Ponte di Monzone along the road and the railway, and Monzone Alto on a rocky spur under the church of San Prospero.

Up the Equi branch, Equi Terme has sulphurous springs used since Roman times, karst caves open to visitors, a rock shelter (the Tecchia di Equi) with traces of Neanderthals and cave bears, and the Solco di Equi, a narrow canyon towards Pizzo d’Uccello.

Downstream, Gragnola, the valley’s historic market town, sits below the Malaspina Castello dell’Aquila. In the 19th century, marble quarried on Monte Sagro brought the valley a short period of prosperity; Monzone station’s freight yard served the marble trade, with the stone brought down by an aerial cableway. The Lucca–Aulla railway still climbs the valley through Gragnola, Monzone and Equi Terme.

The playable map covers the whole valley, ridge to ridge: 7.8 × 10 km, from Gragnola up to 1,800 m. It includes:

- **Monzone**: the station quarter on Via Cesare Battisti, the Carabinieri station, and the stone lanes of Monzone Alto
- **Vinca**: the stone village at the head of the western branch, at the end of the SP59’s hairpins, under Pizzo d’Uccello and Monte Sagro
- **Equi Terme**: the spa village up the eastern branch, with its own station, and above it the Solco di Equi gorge with the old marble road’s tunnels and its quarries
- **Gragnola**: the old town at the mouth of the valley, on the SR445 della Garfagnana and the Aulella, with the Castello dell’Aquila on the hill nearby
- **The hill villages**: Tenerano, Viano, Pieve di Viano, Colognola, Campiglione and Vezzanello west of the Lucido; Ugliancaldo on the ridge above the Solco
- **The Apuan ridge**: Pizzo d’Uccello’s north face, the Garnerone, Foce di Vinca, Monte Sagro and Monte Borla, with the white marble quarries of the Sagro basin
- **Hamlets and back roads**: Aiola, Mezzana, Codiponte and Casciana, with the woods, streams and hairpins in between

Roads, rivers, the railway, woods and place names come from OpenStreetMap. Buildings (with their surveyed eave heights), road widths and surfaces come from Regione Toscana’s 1:2000 technical map (2019), the terrain from its 1 m LiDAR surveys (2010 and 2012), and the bare rock, pastures and quarries from its land-cover map (2019).

## Requirements to run and build the game

You need:

- **Node 24**: runs the TypeScript tests and map tools directly, with no build step
- **pnpm 10**: `packageManager` pins it in `package.json`, and `corepack enable` installs it
- **A browser with WebGL**: plus Web Audio for the sound

## Play in the browser

Every push to `main` publishes the game to GitHub Pages at <https://gta-lunigiana.fedemas.dev/> (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

## Run the game locally

Install the dependencies and start the dev server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`. The server listens on the local network too, so a phone or another computer on the same network can play: open the `Network` address that Vite prints. Anyone on that network can reach it, so stop it on a shared network you don't trust. Every load is a new world, starting on today’s date at 08:00 Rome time once you dismiss the title card. Add `?seed=N` (for example `http://localhost:5173/?seed=42`) to replay the same world: the seed drives every random choice, so the same seed and the same keys give the same game.

In dev mode, the backslash key toggles the Ritmo monitor, P toggles the debug menu, and `http://localhost:5173/lab.html` opens the audio audition page: every sound on a button, its params on sliders, heard from a distance you pick (see [docs/audio.md](docs/audio.md#the-audition-page)). The debug menu sets the time (stop the clock or run it 10 or 60 times faster, pick the time of day and the date, jump to sunrise or sunset), the weather (leave it to the day’s plan or force a regime, settled at once if you like, with this month’s odds and the weather seed read out) and the vehicle handling. The handling knobs it changes stay for the next load; the time and the weather do not (see [docs/weather.md](docs/weather.md#the-hud-and-the-dev-menu)).

## Controls on foot and driving

The same keys walk and drive; the table shows what each does in both modes:

| Key | On foot | Driving |
|---|---|---|
| W A S D or arrow keys | walk along the screen directions | up: throttle, down: brake and reverse, left/right: steer |
| Shift | sprint | |
| F or Enter | enter the nearest vehicle (steal, enter or carjack) | get out |
| Q / E | turn the view a quarter left / right | nothing: the view follows the car |
| Space | | handbrake |
| H | | horn while held; in the Carabinieri car, siren on or off |
| M | full map (pauses the game); M, Esc or a click closes it | same |
| Esc | settings, which pause the game: the vehicle physics (Simulation, Balanced or Arcade; a new game starts on Balanced); Esc or Resume closes them. With the full map open, Esc closes the map instead | same |
| P (dev builds only) | debug menu: the time of day, the clock’s speed and the date, the weather, and the vehicle physics presets and handling knobs for every vehicle at once; P closes it, and so does Esc while it has the focus | same |

Crashes wear vehicles out, the truck far less than a small car: a damaged engine pulls weaker and misfires, smokes white, then black, and once destroyed it burns and nobody can drive it again. 5–10 s later it explodes: the blast wrecks the cars beside it, which catch fire in turn, and kills the people nearby, you too if you are still inside or standing next to it; you come back on foot at the start 4 s later ([docs/gameplay.md](docs/gameplay.md#damage)).

The bindings live in `bindings` in `src/sim/schema.ts`. The HUD shows the street and district you’re in, the time in Rome (HH:MM) with the weather and the temperature where you stand (for example “Rain · 9 °C”), cars stolen, people hit, the action the key would take, a speedometer while driving, a minimap, and “Sei morto” when you are killed. On screens 600 px wide or narrower the clock sits under the score. M, or a click on the minimap, opens the full map: the whole area north-up with the villages, hamlets and main peaks named and your position marked.

### Touch controls on a phone or tablet

Where a touch screen is the main pointer, the game runs in mobile mode: the controls are on the screen, so no keyboard or mouse is needed, and the game is always landscape. A phone held upright shows the game turned a quarter, to be held sideways. On Android, the first tap also takes the game full screen and locks it to landscape. On foot a stick walks; in a vehicle, buttons take its place. The controls press the same keys as the keyboard:

| Control | On foot | Driving |
|---|---|---|
| Stick: a thumb on the left half | walk along the screen directions | |
| ◀ / ▶ on the left | | steer left / right |
| Gas / Brake on the right | | throttle / brake, then reverse |
| Run | sprint | |
| Steal, Enter, Carjack or Exit (shown only when it would act) | enter the nearest vehicle | get out |
| ↺ / ↻ | turn the view a quarter left / right | hidden: the view follows the car |
| Hand brake | | handbrake |
| Horn | | horn while held; in the Carabinieri car, siren on or off |
| A tap on the minimap | full map (pauses the game); a tap closes it | same |
| II, top right | settings (pauses the game); Resume closes them | same |

## How the game sounds

The browser synthesises every sound with Web Audio, with no sample files: engines voiced from how each is built and revved by the drive simulation (rough, knocking and misfiring once crashes wear them), wrecks burning and then exploding, tyres that squeal when they skid, horns and the Carabinieri siren, crashes, footsteps, people chatting in Italian-sounding gibberish with a real word now and then (the way The Sims talk) and crying out in real Italian, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, wind, rain on the ground and on the car’s roof, thunder, crickets in warm, dry air, birds by day and the owl at night, the village church bells striking the game’s hours, and the Lucido and its streams.

Each sound reaches you through outdoor acoustics. It fades with distance and under the background noise, so you hear only what’s near. Houses and hills muffle it, the air dulls it, its pitch shifts as it passes, far crashes arrive late, and loud ones echo off the slopes.

The first key, click or tap once the game has loaded, the one that dismisses the title card, starts the sound. See [docs/audio.md](docs/audio.md) for the details.

## Package scripts

Every script runs with `pnpm`:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Vite dev server on port 5173, open to the local network (`--host`) |
| `pnpm build` | production build into `dist/` (the Pages workflow adds `--base=./`) |
| `pnpm preview` | serves `dist/` on port 4173 |
| `pnpm check` | `format:check`, then `typecheck`, then `lint`, then `test` |
| `pnpm format` | `oxfmt`: formats the code, JSON, YAML, HTML and CSS in place |
| `pnpm format:check` | `oxfmt --check`: fails on any unformatted file |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc` (no emit) |
| `pnpm lint` | type-aware `oxlint` with the Ritmo plugin and the project's own (`lint/`), warnings failing, then `ritmo-devtools lint src/sim/index.ts` |
| `pnpm test` | `node --test` over `src/**/*.test.ts` and `lint/**/*.test.ts`, each in a `__tests__` folder beside the module it tests |
| `pnpm map` | rebuilds `src/sim/map/monzone.bin` from `data/raw` |
| `pnpm fetch-osm` | downloads the OpenStreetMap extract again into `data/raw/lunigiana.osm.gz` |
| `pnpm fetch-rt` | downloads the Regione Toscana sources again into `data/raw/rt` |

## Repository layout

The simulation, the browser hosts and the map tools live in separate folders:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/sim/` | the simulation: Ritmo schema, systems, collision, routes, drive physics (chassis, tyres, drivetrain, the arcade assists), crash damage, the handling knobs and presets, the animal species, tuning. Headless and deterministic |
| `src/sim/sky/` | the game clock and Rome’s calendar, the map’s place, the sun and the moon, the national climate model and its daily odds, the day plan, the weather regimes and what the weather is at a point (temperature, rain and snow, wet and snowy ground, fog, wind) |
| `src/sim/systems/` | one file per system group (spawn, enter/exit, foot, drive, traffic, pedestrians, perception and reactions, animals, physics, contacts, damage, explosions, populate, populate animals, sky) |
| `src/sim/population/` | who lives where and who goes out: residents from the buildings, people's looks, parties, farms |
| `src/sim/map/` | the generated map (`monzone.bin`), its decoder, types and lookups (heights, walls, road graph, ground elevation, surfaces, land cover) |
| `src/render/` | Three.js host code: pixel pipeline, static world meshes, people, animal and vehicle models, blood pools, tyre marks and smoke, damaged engines' smoke and fire, explosions and charred wrecks, the render schedule; `sky/` lights the day and the night and draws the weather (fog, snow, wet ground, cloud shadows, rain and snow, lightning, street lamps, lit windows, headlights) |
| `src/audio/` | Web Audio host code: the audio schedule, the acoustics director (vehicles, people, conversations, animals, the valley, the time of day, the weather and the thunder), the speaker and mixer, the synths, the audition page |
| `src/audio/speech/` | the Italian-sounding speech: what people say, and a formant synthesiser that voices it |
| `src/hud/` | DOM HUD: the title card as loading screen, location names, the clock and weather readout, score, prompt, the “Sei morto” card when the player is killed, speedometer, minimap, full map (M), touch controls (mobile mode), settings (Esc) with the vehicle physics, and the dev-only debug menu (P) for the time, the weather and the vehicle handling; the settings and the menu set the handling through one store, the menu the sky through another |
| `src/tools/` | the map pipeline (`build-map.ts`), the downloaders (`fetch-osm.ts`, `fetch-rt.ts`) and a top-down preview renderer |
| `src/boot.ts` | browser entry: downloads the map with progress, then imports the game |
| `src/main.ts` | browser host: builds the scene, makes the runtime, runs the fixed loop |
| `index.html` | canvas, HUD and touch-control markup, title card (the loading screen), and the switch to mobile mode |
| `lab.html` | the audio audition page (dev server only) |
| `data/raw/` | pinned map inputs: OSM extract, Regione Toscana CTR and LiDAR |
| `docs/` | architecture, map pipeline, gameplay, weather and audio notes; `docs/standards/` holds the checks for each part of the game |
| `.oxlintrc.json`, `.oxfmtrc.json`, `lefthook.yml` | lint rules, formatter settings, and the git hooks that format and lint each commit and check each push |
| `lint/` | the project's own oxlint plugins, one file each named after the plugin (`test-files.ts`: each test in a `__tests__` folder) |

## Rebuilding the map

Rebuild the map from the pinned inputs with one command:

```sh
pnpm map
```

The build reads only `data/raw` and takes about 8s. Its output is deterministic: with the same inputs, `monzone.bin` (6.7 MB, gzipped) gunzips to the same bytes on every machine, and comes out byte-identical with the same Node build (another zlib or OS compresses differently). Never edit `monzone.bin` by hand.

The inputs in `data/raw` are:

- `lunigiana.osm.gz`: an OpenStreetMap API 0.6 extract of the play area plus 100 m (lat 44.1060–44.1977, lon 10.0925–10.1925), written by `pnpm fetch-osm` (`src/tools/fetch-osm.ts`) from 4 × 4 `https://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=…` tiles. It fetches every land-use, natural, building, leisure or amenity multipolygon whole with `https://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/<id>/full`, because most of a forest’s member ways lie outside the play area. It merges the elements by id and sorts them, so the same OSM data always gives the same file.
- `rt/`: Regione Toscana data from the Geoscopio cartoteca, written by `pnpm fetch-rt` (`src/tools/fetch-rt.ts`, which needs `unzip`; the download URLs are pinned there):
  - `ctr/<sheet>_<layer>.shp.gz` + `.dbf.gz`: CTR 1:2000 (2019), the 25 sheets that map ground in the play area (23D11–15, 23D18–21, 23D26–31, 23D34–37, 23D43, 23D46, 23D47, 23D53–55), layers `AED` (buildings with eave elevations), `AGE` (garages, ruins), `AVI` (road surfaces with street names) and `AZR` (the area each sheet maps).
  - `dtm.bin` + `dtm.json`: the 1 m LiDAR terrain model, 46 tiles of the 2010 flight and 19 of the 2012 flight (Monte Sagro and the Carrara side), mosaicked, cropped to the play area plus 32 m and averaged to 2 m cells. The 0.65 km² no flight covers come from the 10 m DTM.
  - `ucs.json.gz`: the land cover 1:10 000 (2019) polygons the build uses (quarries, bare rock, sparse vegetation, pastures, heath), from the Regione Toscana WFS.

Downloading the OSM data again pulls current edits, so the map changes; the files in `data/raw` pin it. `node src/tools/preview-map.ts` draws a top-down PNG of the built map (see [docs/map.md](docs/map.md)).
